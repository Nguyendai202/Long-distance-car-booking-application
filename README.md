[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This is a Java Swing-based application for booking long-distance rides between provinces in Vietnam. The application provides a convenient way for users to book rides, select their desired destinations, and manage their bookings efficiently.

## Features

- User Registration and Login: Users can create an account or login with their existing credentials to access the application.
- Province Selection: Users can select their departure and destination provinces from a comprehensive list of provinces in Vietnam.
- Ride Booking: Users can book a ride by specifying their preferred departure date, time, and the number of passengers. The application will search for available rides based on the selected provinces and display the options to the user.
- Ride Details: Users can view detailed information about each available ride, including the departure and arrival times, the vehicle type, and the fare.
- Booking Management: Users can manage their bookings, including viewing their upcoming and past rides, canceling bookings if necessary, and reviewing their booking history.
- Payment Integration: The application integrates with a secure payment gateway, allowing users to make online payments for their rides.
- User Profile: Users can update their profile information, including their contact details and preferences.
- Optimal Route Recommendation: The application utilizes an advanced algorithm to find the shortest route between provinces, considering factors such as distance and price. This allows us to recommend the top 5 most suitable rides for customers based on their preferences for either price or proximity.
